Session: Spring Boot context + batch job end-to-end
====================================================

Summary
-------
Added full Spring Boot 3.2.3 application that boots a real Spring context,
wires all SQL DSL integration beans, and runs a batch job end-to-end against
H2 in Oracle compatibility mode. The job reads 3 PENDING orders using the
type-safe DSL, joins with customers, and logs results.

Files added
-----------
- BatchApplication.java          @SpringBootApplication entry point
- ExampleBatchJobConfig.java     2 providers, registry wiring, Job+Step+Reader
- OrderDto.java                  Record for RowMapper output
- application.yml                H2 Oracle mode, batch schema init
- schema.sql                     4 tables matching existing Table definitions
- data.sql                       Sample data (5 orders, 3 customers, 3 products, 3 payments)
- SpringContextTest.java         6 integration tests (context, beans, job exec, read count)

Files modified
--------------
- pom.xml                        spring-boot-starter-parent 3.2.3, starter-batch, H2, boot plugin

Discoveries
-----------
1. Boot 3.2 auto-config (no @EnableBatchProcessing) is sufficient — provides
   JobRepository, JobLauncher, PlatformTransactionManager, and auto-runs jobs.
   @EnableBatchProcessing actually DISABLES Boot auto-config in 3.x.

2. H2 MODE=Oracle handles standard SQL from the DSL without issues. Column
   aliasing, JOINs, parameterized WHERE all work identically to Oracle.

3. JDBC ResultSet column label lookup is case-insensitive, so the DSL's
   lowercase column names (o.id, o.amount) match H2's uppercase labels.

4. Test commands need `test-compile` not `compile` for src/test/java classes.
   The CLAUDE.md docs say `mvn compile exec:java` but that only compiles main
   sources — test classes require `mvn test-compile exec:java`.

5. SpringBatchQueryConfig (existing) is auto-scanned and provides
   BatchReaderFactory + empty QueryProviderRegistry. ExampleBatchJobConfig
   populates the registry via @Autowired method injection, which runs during
   config class init — guaranteed before @Bean methods that depend on it.

6. JdbcCursorItemReader is safe for multiple job runs as a singleton bean.
   open()/close() manage cursor lifecycle per step execution; bean config
   (SQL, DataSource, PreparedStatementSetter) is immutable after creation.
